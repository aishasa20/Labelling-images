# Labelling-images

This project explores image classification using the CIFAR-100 dataset and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture implemented in TensorFlow with Keras.

# Dependencies

Python 3.x

NumPy

pandas

seaborn

matplotlib

TensorFlow (2.x recommended)

Keras


# Installation and Execution

Install Dependencies 

pip install numpy pandas seaborn matplotlib tensorflow keras scikit-learn

Run the code:

python cifar100_classification.py 

# Notes:

Experiment with different CNN architectures, hyperparameters, and data augmentation techniques.
Consider using other evaluation metrics, such as precision, recall, and F1-score, to get a more comprehensive performance analysis
Explore techniques to address overfitting.
